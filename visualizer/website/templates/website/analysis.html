<h1>Analysis Page</h1>
<p>The dataset that we modified was the 'Inpatient Prospective Payment System' set available at data.cms.gov. It featured the top 100 medical procedures in the United States and basic information regarding them. This included the cost per state of said procedures, in regards to total average cost terms, for each of the 100 procedures. Separately pulled was the state population numbers for the year the study was conducted (2015-2016). The above data was manipulated to give an impression of what the most and least expensive procedures per person in each distinct state, and the average number of procedures per person in each state. </p>
<br>
<p>To find the most/least expensive procedures in each state, we isolated each state, sorted the total cost columns to find the max and min values, and normalized by the population of the given state to find average cost per state per person if the procedure was the most or least expensive. Surprisingly, the results were irrespective of location: Major, Small, and Large Bowel Procedures were the most expensive and Cardiac Arrythmia/Chest Pain were the least expensive. However, cost differences illustrated by the graphs reveal that more populous states experience higher costs per person. </p>
<br>
<p>Another important visualization to add was the average number of procedures per person in a state. Simply summing the number of procedures in state and normalizing by population for a state achieved the result. The average number of cases and symptoms revealed Illinois had a greater amount of reported cases and symptoms versus the rest of the United States. Once again, population is thought to be a large factor in this result. </p>
<br> 
<p>Finally, the percentage of operations that occurred in each state was calculated. This proved to be a very powerful computation as our predicitons proved to be correct. There was strong speculation on population trumping the number and cost of cases, but after visualizing this set, which was also normalized by state population, California and Texas were still the largest. Therefore, a person is more suseptible to experiencing more cases and symptoms in more populated areas, while still having to pay more, than in an equivalent rural area. </p>

# big-data-hackathon-2017
This repository contains the materials created during the UIowa Big Data Hackathon from September 16th to September 18th.

One of the data visualizations was of the cost per person of a specific procedure for any given state.
This data can be further augmented to see which procedures are most cost-efficient in a state vs most-expensive.
Furthermore, cross-comparing states for most cost-efficient procedures in the United States is also viable.
